Method 1 of `analtsis.m` produces the following pixel result:

Up for improvement: the thresholding of the binarization process after normalizing the demodulated signal. Currently the criteria is 1 standard deviation away from the median.
Method three offers an interesting idea to the discussion: shifting the signal down to baseband. However, obtaining clean signals from the resulting sinusoid superposition is far from ideal.
